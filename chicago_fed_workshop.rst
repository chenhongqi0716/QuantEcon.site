Scientific Computing in Economics with Python and Julia
==========================================================

A Workshop at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 
----------------------------------------------------

**Dates**: 23rd--25th May, 2016

Presenters: `Chase Coleman <https://github.com/cc7768>`_, `Matthew McKay <https://github.com/mmcky>`_
`John Stachurski <http://johnstachurski.net/>`_, and `Pablo Winant <https://github.com/albop>`_

`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ and `Julia <http://julialang.org/>`_ are
are attracting rapidly growing interest as languages for scientific computing
that successfully combine high productivity and
high performance.  This workshop will provide an intensive, three day
introduction to programming in Python and Julia, centered around the needs and
interests of economists.  Our target audience is economists with 

#. Some experience with programming (in, e.g., MATLAB, Fortran, STATA)

#. Zero experience with either Python or Julia

Much of the content will be based on lectures from `quant-econ.net
<http://quant-econ.net>`__.  The workshop will be hands on and centered around
a combination of lectures and exercises.  Participants are asked to bring laptops.  Further
instructions will be given closer to the date.

Topics covered in the course will include

* Installation and execution of code in both languages

* Basic and more advanced language syntax 

* Scientific computing

* Achieving high performance from within Python and Julia

* Working with data (mainly Python)

* Solving static and dynamic models: applications and examples

  * Markov chains and linear state space models

  * Simple asset pricing models

  * Dynamic programming

  * Income fluctuation and household savings problems

  * `Dolo modeling language <http://dolo.readthedocs.org/en/doc/>`_
