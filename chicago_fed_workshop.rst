are attracting rapidly growing interest as languages for scientific computing
that successfully combine high productivity and
high performance.  This workshop will provide an intensive, three day
introduction to programming in Python and Julia, centered around the needs and
interests of economists.  Some of the content will be based on lectures from `quant-econ.net
<http://quant-econ.net>`__.  

Resources
