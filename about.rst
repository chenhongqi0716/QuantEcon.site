QuantEcon is an organization dedicated to improving economic modeling by enhancing the coding skills and computational tool set of economists through development of and exposure to modern open source computational methods for research, econometrics, and decision making.

QuantEcon aims to build coding skills and code libraries centered on outstanding open source scientific computing environments such as Python, R and Julia.  Current QuantEcon activities include the `Quantitative Economics lectures <http://quant-econ.net/>`_ on Python and Julia, the QuantEcon code libraries (`Python <http://quantecon.org/python_index.html>`_/`Julia <http://quantecon.org/julia_index.html>`_) and the `Open Notebook Archive <http://quantecon.org/notebooks.html>`_.
