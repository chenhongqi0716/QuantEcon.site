Econometric Society Workshop on Python and Julia
=====================================================

June 16, 2016

This workshop will provide a quick start introduction to programming in Python
and Julia for economists.  Our target audience is economists with some
experience with programming in Matlab, Stata or similar, who are curious about
Python and Julia, and how they might be useful for research in quantitative
economics. 

Content will be based on the introductory lectures from `quant-econ.net <http://quant-econ.net>`__.  The workshop will be hands on and participants are asked to bring their laptops.  Further instructions will be
given closer to the date.

The workshop will run as part of the `North American Summer Meeting of the Econometric Society <http://sites.sas.upenn.edu/nasm-2016/>`__.

Those interested please register for the workshop through the conference
registration system once it opens.
